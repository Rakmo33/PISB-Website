# 🌐 PISB Website  
*Official Website of PICT IEEE Student Branch*

This project is the **official website of the PICT IEEE Student Branch (PISB)**, built collaboratively as a **team project during college**.  
The website serves as a central digital presence for the student club, showcasing its **vision, domains, events, activities, and contact information**.

The project was intentionally developed as a **purely static website** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, and deployed on **GoDaddy using cPanel**, reflecting real-world constraints and learning during early-stage web development.

## 📚 Key Learnings

### 🔁 Maintainability Challenges
- Repetitive HTML across multiple pages  
- Manual updates required for shared components (navbar, footer)  
- High effort to maintain consistency  

### 🧠 Realization of Framework Needs
- Felt the strong need for **component-based frameworks**  
- Understood the value of reusability and modularity  
- Appreciated templating, routing, and state management  

### ⚠️ Limitations of Pure Static Approach
- No build pipeline or optimization  
- Limited scalability for feature additions  
- Difficult collaboration as the codebase grows  

> This project became a **turning point** that motivated the transition to modern frameworks like **React and Angular**.
